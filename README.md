### Steganography is like hiding a secret message inside another message, like hiding a treasure in a toy box. Just like how you might write a secret note to your friend and hide it in a toy box, steganography is a way to hide secret information, like a message or a picture, inside another message or picture. This way, only the people who know the secret can find and read the message.
